# This is a CLI tool for creating a js playground

It helps to create a javascript playground directory. The directory contains prettier, eslint and simple webpack configuration.

## Usage

install the package

```bash
yarn global add create-playground

```

Once that's done, you can run this command inside your project's directory...

```bash
playground
```

cd the dir you create(it could be something like _playground2_ if there is a dir call _playground_ already exists).

```bash
cd playground
yarn dev
```

Then you should see the **Hello Webpack!** page in your browser!
